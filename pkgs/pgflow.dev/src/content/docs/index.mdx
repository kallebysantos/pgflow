Edge Worker is an attempt to provide a decent task queue worker
for Supabase, running on top of their Edge Functions and PGMQ.

It is designed to automatically **spawn new instance when terminated** and
to **gracefully abort and restart** pending jobs.

You can start using it in 3 minutes.

<Steps>

1. #### Create your worker

    Call your supabase CLI as usual to create new function:

    ```typescript
    npx supabase functions new my-edge-worker
    ```

    Replace contents of generated `index.ts` with the following:

    ```typescript
    import { EdgeWorker } from "@pgflow/edge-worker";

    EdgeWorker.start(async (message: { urlToScrape: string }) => {
      // do something with the message
    });
    ```

2. #### Download and run migration

    Run following bash script to download migration file to your project.
    Replace `<supabase-dir>` with path to `supabase/` directory.

    ```bash
    wget -O <supabase-dir>/migrations/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/main/edge-worker/migrations/edge-worker.sql
    ```

    Then migrate, as usual:

    ```bash
    npx supabase migration up
    ```

3. #### Start your worker

    You can start worker by making an http request to its edge function:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/my-edge-worker
    ```

4. #### Enqueue a job

    Worker by default polls for messages on PGMQ queue named `default`.

    You just need to send a message to that queue:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT pgmq.send('default', '{'urlToScrape': 'https://example.com'}'::jsonb);
    ```

    Worker should start processing the message immediately.

    <Aside>
      You can create the queue yourself or let worker do it during startup.

      You can also configure the queue name by passing a second configuration map
      (see more in the docs).
