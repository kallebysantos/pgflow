**Edge Worker** is a task queue worker for Supabase that runs on top of Edge Functions and PGMQ.

It treats Edge Function termination due to CPU/clock limits
as an expected occurrence and includes extra measures to handle it as part of
normal operations:

- stops polling as soon as the soft limit is reached
- makes extra effort to gracefully abort pending jobs with abort signals
- uses PGMQ's visibility timeout to ensure **no job is ever lost**
- **spawns new instances** automatically for **continuous operations**
- pings db with **heartbeats** to ensure we know worker is alive

## ðŸš€ Get started

<Aside type="caution" title="Requirements">
You need to have the Supabase CLI installed and a local project set up before continuing.
If not, please follow Supabase's [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) first.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. #### Create your worker

    Use the Supabase CLI to create a new function:

    ```typescript
    import { EdgeWorker } from "@pgflow/edge-worker";

    EdgeWorker.start(async (payload: { urlToScrape: string }) => {
      // do something with the message
      console.log('Scraping URL...', urlToScrape);
    });
    ```

2. #### Update your schema

    Run this command to download the migration file to your project.
    Replace `<supabase-dir>` with your project's `supabase/` directory path.

    ```bash
    wget -O <supabase-dir>/migrations/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgflow-dev/pgflow/main/edge-worker/migrations/edge-worker.sql
    ```

    Then apply the migration:

    ```bash
    npx supabase migration up
    ```

3. #### Start your worker

    Start the worker by making an HTTP request to its edge function:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/my-edge-worker
    ```

4. #### Process your first message

    By default, the worker polls for messages from a PGMQ queue named `default` (this name is configurable).

    Send a test message to the queue:

    ```sql
    SELECT pgmq.send('default', '{"urlToScrape": "https://example.com"}'::jsonb);
    ```

    The worker will process the message immediately.

    <Aside title="Queues">
      If you haven't created the queue beforehand, the worker will automatically create
      a logged, non-partitioned queue during startup.
