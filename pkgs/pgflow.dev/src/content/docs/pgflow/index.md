**pgflow** is a Postgres-first workflow engine I began building in November. I wanted a **deeply integrated**, open-source solution that **runs entirely on Supabase—no external workers or self-hosting required**. Since I couldn’t find one, I decided to build it.

##### Can I use it yet?

**Not yet** - I'm aiming to have the first version ready in early 2024.

Living with **ADHD**, I bring a lot of **hyperfocus** and **passion** to this project, but my process can be a bit scattered at times, and the scope can feel huge.
The worker, a critical piece of pgflow, is already extracted from my private stuff and lives happily in a new monorepo. Stay tuned!

##### Have questions or want to say Hi?

I'm `u/jumski` on Reddit, [@jumski](https://github.com/jumski) on GitHub and `@jumski` on Supabase Discord.
