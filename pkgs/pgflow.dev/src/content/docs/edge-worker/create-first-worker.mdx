Setting up your first worker is easy and you will be up and running in no time.

**Edge Worker** is in alpha stage and it is not production ready yet,
but we will get there!

Before we start, make sure read the [Get started](/get-started) guide.

<Steps>


1. ### Create your worker

    Use the Supabase CLI to create a new function. Edge Worker handles HTTP requests internally, so replace the function's content with:

    ```typescript
    import { EdgeWorker } from "@pgflow/edge-worker";

    EdgeWorker.start(async (payload: { urlToScrape: string }) => {
      // do something with the message
      console.log('Scraping URL...', payload.urlToScrape);
    });
    ```

3. ### Start your worker

    Start the worker by making an HTTP request to its edge function:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/<function-name>
    ```

4. ### Process your first message

    By default, the worker looks for messages in the `tasks` queue (this name is configurable).

    Send a test message to the queue:

    ```sql
    SELECT pgmq.send(
      queue_name => 'tasks',
      msg => '{"urlToScrape": "https://example.com"}'::jsonb
    );
    ```

    The worker will process the message immediately.

    <Aside title="Creating queues">
      If you haven't created the queue beforehand, the worker will automatically create
      a logged, non-partitioned queue during startup.
