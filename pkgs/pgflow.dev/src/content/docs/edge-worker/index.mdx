### How it works?

**Edge Worker** is a task queue worker for Supabase that runs on top of Edge Functions and PGMQ.
It is a layer on top of [Supabase Background Tasks](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/background-tasks) that adds retries, proper queue management, monitoring, heartbeats, concurrency control and others.

It treats Edge Function termination due to CPU/clock limits
as an expected occurrence and includes extra measures to handle it as part of
normal operations:

- stops polling as soon as the soft limit is reached
- makes extra effort to gracefully abort pending tasks with abort signals
- uses PGMQ's visibility timeout to ensure **no message is ever lost**
- **spawns new instances** automatically for **continuous operations**
- pings the database with **heartbeats** to ensure the worker's health
