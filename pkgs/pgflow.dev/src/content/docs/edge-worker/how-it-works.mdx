**Edge Worker** is your regular task queue worker, getting message off a queue and calling user functions with its payload.

Under the hood, it wraps [Supabase Background Tasks](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions/background-tasks) and adds lot of useful features:

- retries with delays
- monitoring and heartbeats
- concurrency control
- horizontal scaling (by deploying more edge functions for same queue)

It treats Edge Function termination due to CPU/clock limits
as an expected occurrence and includes extra measures to handle it as part of
normal operations:

- stops polling as soon as the soft limit is reached
- makes extra effort to gracefully abort pending tasks with abort signals
- uses PGMQ's visibility timeout to ensure **no message is ever lost**
- **spawns new instances** automatically for **continuous operations**
- pings the database with **heartbeats** to ensure the worker's health
